        <p><b><u>ABOUT ME:</u>	&#129299;</b><br><br><b><em>Hello lovelies, Divya here! </em>&#128512;</b><br><br>I have always loved cakes and desserts. I started baking when I finished my schooling. The first thing I baked was a batch of vanilla cupcakes with my sister. We got Betty Crocker cake mix and still managed to burn a couple of cupcakes :) haha!!. I, however, enjoyed the entire process so much that I decided to do it more often. I had no idea that it will grow into something so big and will become such an important part of me. I started posting pictures of my cakes on Social media and surprisingly got a great response from the lovely community. This encouraged me to experiment more and work on my styling- something I love doing now.</p>
